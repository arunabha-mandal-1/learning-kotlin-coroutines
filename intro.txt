Thread: A thread describes in which context some sequence of instructions should be executed.

In android apps if we don't use multithreading, it runs on main thread.

Coroutines: 1. Executed within a thread 2. Unlike threads Coroutines are suspendable 3. Unlike threads Coroutines can switch their context(one thread -> another thread).

Coroutines: Lightweight threads with some useful extra functionalities.
